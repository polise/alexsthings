      <p>My name is Alex. I am a multi-doer. I play a lot of instruments not that well. That sort of thing is normal for me; I do a lot of everything but not that well. This website is a good example of a time when I was supposed to be learning how to paint or going for a voice-over audition but decided to make a website instead. Because, who knows what's going to work out. I have my money in a very varied set of stocks.</p>

        I have more of me elsewhere. My instagram is
        <a href="http://www.instagram.com/alexandrepolise"> here. </a>
        Some of my writing is
        <a href="https://medium.com/@alexandrepolise"> here .</a>
